# Through-the-Lens Drone Filming

"Through-the-Lens Drone Filming" represents a novel drone control system, which allows a cameraman to conveniently control the drone by manipulating a 3D model in the preview, which closes the gap between the ﬂight control and the viewpoint design. 

Our system includes two key enabling techniques: 1) subject localization based on visual-inertial fusion, and 2) through-the-lens camera planning. This is the ﬁrst drone camera system which allows users to capture human actions by manipulating the camera in a virtual environment. 

The code is required to be deployed on Android device and DJI M100.
